    "# Probability and Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the durability calculation, let's set up some well-known\n",
    "starting points.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the [Binomial Coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient) tells you\n",
    "the number of ways to choose $n$ things from a set of $n$ things.  You say \"n choose k\" and write: $\\binom{n}{k}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Related to this is the [Probability Mass Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution#Probability_mass_function) for a binomial.\n",
    "This is used to calculate the probability of exactly $k$ things happening out of $n$ trials, if\n",
    "the probability of each thing happening is $p$, and they are independent.\n",
    "The probability is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\binom{n}{k} \\: p^k \\: (1-p)^{n-k}$$\n",

    "# Failure Rate vs. Probability of Failure\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction between failure rates and the probability of failure causes\n",
    "lots of confusion.  I have to think about it carefully each time I come back\n",
    "to the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *failure rate* over a period of time, is the average number of failures\n",
    "in that time.  It's usually expressed as a percentage.  An annual failure \n",
    "rate of 25% means that the average number of failures in a year is $0.25$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Failure rates for unreliable things can be over 100%.  This is counter-intuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "An annual failure rate of 1200% would mean that on average you would see\n",
    "12 failures per year.  An annual failure rate of 1200% is the same thing\n",
    "as a monthly failure rate of 100%, and is the same thing as a daily\n",
    "failure rate of 3.33% (assuming 30-day months).\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of failure over a period of time is modeled with the\n",
    "[Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution).\n",
    "I won't go over all the details here (see Wikipedia for that), but the \n",
    "probability of having one or more failures over a time interval, with \n",
    "a failure rate of $\\lambda$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$1 \\: - \\: e^{-\\lambda}$$\n",

    "# Data Durability\n",
    "\n",
    "First, some naming.  We will use these names in the calculations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $S$ is the total number of shards (data plus parity)\n",
    "* $R$ is the repair time for a shard in days: how long it takes to replace a shard after it fails\n",
    "* $A$ is the annual failure rate of one shard\n",
    "* $F$ is the failure rate of a shard in $R$ days\n",
    "* $P$ is the probability of a shard failing at least once in $R$ days\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the assumptions we make is that it takes $R$ days to repair a failed\n",
    "shard.  Let's start with a simpler problem and look at the data durability\n",
    "over a period of $R$ days.  For a data loss to happen in this time period,\n",
    "$P+1$ shards (or more) would have to fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use $A$ to denote the annual failure rate of individual shards.\n",
    "Over one year, the chances that a shard will fail is evenly distributed over\n",
    "all of the $R$-day periods in the year.  We will use $F$ to denote the failure\n",
    "rate of one shard in an $R$-day period:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F = A\\frac{R}{365}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of failure of a single shard in R days is approximately $F$, when $F$ is small.\n",
    "The exact value, from the Poisson distribution is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P = 1 \\: - \\: e^{-F}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the probability of one shard failing, we can use the binomial distribution's \n",
    "probability mass function to calculate the probability of exactly $n$ of the $D+P$\n",
    "shards failing:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\binom{S}{n} \\: P^n \\: (1-P)^{S-n}$$\n",
    "        \n",
    "We also lose data if more than n shards fail in the period.  To include those,\n",
    "we can sum the above formula for n through S shards, to get the probability of\n",
    "data loss in $R$ days:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{k=n}^{S} \\binom{S}{n} \\: P^n \\: (1-P)^{S-n}$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "The durability in each period is inverse of that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$1 \\: - \\: \\sum_{k=n}^{S} \\binom{S}{n} \\: P^n \\: (1-P)^{S-n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Durability over the full year \n",
    "happens when there's durability in all of the periods, which is the product of\n",
    "probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Big( 1 - \\sum_{k=n}^{S} \\: \\binom{S}{n} \\: P^n \\: (1-P)^{S-n} \\Big) ^ {365/R}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's the answer!\n"
