    "## Failure Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction between failure rates and the probability of failure causes\n",
    "lots of confusion.  I have to think about it carefully each time I come back\n",
    "to the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *failure rate* for a widget over a period of time is the average number \n",
    "of failures in that period per widget.  An annual failure \n",
    "rate of 0.25 means that on average, there are 0.25 failures per widget.\n",
    "If you have 100 widgets for one year, there would be an average of 25 failures per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "A failure rate of 0.25 is frequently written as 25%.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's counter-intuitive, but failure rates for unreliable widgets can be over \n",
    "1.0 (100%).  An annual failure rate of 12.0 (1200%) would mean that on average \n",
    "you would see 12 failures per year per widget.  An annual failure rate of 12.0 (1200%)\n",
    "is the same thing as a monthly failure rate of 1.0 (100%), and is the same thing as a daily\n",
    "failure rate of 0.0333 (3.33%).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Probability of Failure\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that the probability of separate failures is independent, the probability of failure \n",
    "over a period of time is modeled with the\n",

    "# Data Durability\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we get into calculating the durability of data stored with erasure\n",

    "\n",
    "* $S$ is the total number of shards (data plus parity)\n",
    "* $R$ is the repair time for a shard in days: how long it takes to replace a shard after it fails\n",

    "* $F$ is the failure rate of a shard in $R$ days\n",
    "* $P$ is the probability of a shard failing at least once in $R$ days\n",

    "$P+1$ shards (or more) would have to fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use $A$ to denote the annual failure rate of individual shards.\n",
    "Over one year, the chances that a shard will fail is evenly distributed over\n",

    "$$F = A\\frac{R}{365}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of failure of a single shard in R days is approximately $F$, when $F$ is small.\n",
    "The exact value, from the Poisson distribution is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P = 1 \\: - \\: e^{-F}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the probability of one shard failing, we can use the binomial distribution's \n",
